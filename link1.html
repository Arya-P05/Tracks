                        <p>When formatting your resume, it's crucial to strike a balance between readability, professionalism, and highlighting your most relevant experiences and skills. Here are key points to remember:</p>

                        <p><strong>Choose the Right Font:</strong> Use a professional, easy-to-read font like Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman. Keep the font size between 10 and 12 points for the body text and slightly larger for section headings.</p>

                        <p><strong>Utilize Margins and Spacing:</strong> Use standard margins (1” on all sides is a safe bet) to ensure your resume looks tidy and is easy to read. Apply consistent spacing between sections and bullet points to improve readability.</p>

                        <p><strong>Employ a Logical Structure:</strong> Organize your resume in a logical order, typically starting with your name and contact information, followed by a summary or objective, work experience, education, skills, and any other relevant sections (e.g., certifications, volunteer work).</p>

                        <p><strong>Highlight Key Sections:</strong> Use bold and italics sparingly to highlight important information like job titles, employers, or degrees. Consider using bullet points to list achievements or responsibilities, making them easier to scan.</p>

                        <p><strong>Keep It Concise:</strong> Aim for a one-page resume if you have less than 10 years of experience. More experienced professionals can consider a two-page resume. Focus on relevance—only include information that is directly related to the job you’re applying for.</p>

                        <p><strong>Ensure Consistency:</strong> Be consistent in how you format dates, titles, and headings. This includes using the same date format throughout and aligning your text consistently.</p>

                        <p><strong>Use a Header for Contact Information:</strong> Place your name, professional email address, and phone number at the top. You may also include a LinkedIn profile link.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tailor Your Resume:</strong> Customize your resume for each job application. Highlight the experience and skills that align with the job description.</p>

                        <p><strong>Quantify Achievements:</strong> Where possible, use numbers to quantify your achievements. Metrics can provide context and demonstrate the impact of your work.</p>

                        <p><strong>Avoid Common Mistakes:</strong> Steer clear of using first-person pronouns (I, me, my). Double-check for spelling and grammatical errors. Do not include personal information such as age, marital status, or photos unless specifically required.</p>

                        <p><strong>Use Section Headings:</strong> Clearly label each section (e.g., Work Experience, Education) to guide the reader’s eye through your resume.</p>

                        <p><strong>Optimize for ATS:</strong> Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes. Use keywords from the job description and a straightforward layout to ensure your resume is ATS-friendly.</p>

                        <p><strong>Proofread:</strong> Review your resume multiple times and consider having someone else look it over to catch any mistakes you may have missed.</p>

                        <p>By following these guidelines, you can create a well-organized and professional resume that effectively showcases your qualifications and grabs the attention of hiring managers.</p>

                        <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
                        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
