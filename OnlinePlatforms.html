              <strong>Challenge:</strong> Develop innovative content (ideas and
              examples), build content strategies for our various platforms and
              analyze algorithm patterns we can capitalize on. Can you
              incorporate western media trends to present Satsang teachings in a
              compelling way?
            </p>

            <h5>
              <strong>Areas of Interest:</strong>
            </h5>

            <p>
              <strong>Trending Topics:</strong> To engage with youth, we want
              topics and messages that resonate with our audiences. What kind of
              topics are trending and impactful? Analyze popular social media
              platforms, podcasts, and YouTube channels. Look for trends in
              content formats, as well as what topics that are relevant to youth
              and how we can tie that in with Satsang teachings.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Developing Content:</strong> Develop engaging content
              (articles,
              <span style="color: #eea618">videos, social media posts</span>)
              that effectively conveys Satsang teachings while being engaging
              for today's youth. What are content ideas that might achieve this
              task?
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Use a Header for Contact Information:</strong> Place your
              name, professional email address, and phone number at the top. You
              may also include a LinkedIn profile link.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Tailor Your Resume:</strong> Customize your resume for
              each job application. Highlight the experience and skills that
              align with the job description.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Quantify Achievements:</strong> Where possible, use
              numbers to quantify your achievements. Metrics can provide context
              and demonstrate the impact of your work.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Avoid Common Mistakes:</strong> Steer clear of using
              first-person pronouns (I, me, my). Double-check for spelling and
              grammatical errors. Do not include personal information such as
              age, marital status, or photos unless specifically required.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Use Section Headings:</strong> Clearly label each section
              (e.g., Work Experience, Education) to guide the reader’s eye
              through your resume.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Optimize for ATS:</strong> Many companies use Applicant
              Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes. Use keywords from the
              job description and a straightforward layout to ensure your resume
              is ATS-friendly.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Proofread:</strong> Review your resume multiple times and
              consider having someone else look it over to catch any mistakes
              you may have missed.
            </p>

            <p>
              By following these guidelines, you can create a well-organized and
              professional resume that effectively showcases your qualifications
              and grabs the attention of hiring managers.

            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.
